## History

There is already a working version which we'd like to redesign and rewrite to work better in a number of use-cases, e.g. integrating with gitops workflows, deploying different topologies in different kafka-clusters.

This existing version is in maintenance mode, not actively worked on. Feel free to check it out here, but we won't support it in the future.

## Current status

The planning and development of the new version of kafkakewl has been started, watch this repo for updates!
